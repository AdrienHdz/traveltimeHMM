#' Computing the posterior marginals of hidden state variables using a sequence of observations
#' 
#' \code{forwardback} implements Russell and Norvig's forward-backward algorithm that is used
#' at step 3 of Algorithm 1 in Woodard et al.
#' 
#' @param probTran An \code{nObs x nQ^2} matrix having each row represent 
#' \eqn{P(Obs_k | state_k ) * P(state_k | state_{k-1})}.  Each row of \code{probTran} is such that
#' \code{matrix(probTran[1,], ncol=nQ, nrow=nQ, byrow =TRUE)} is the probability above in matrix format.
#' @param initQ A \code{nQ}-sized vector that represents the initial probability of the first link in a trip.
#' 
#' @return \code{probTran} returns a list of \code{alpha} and \code{beta}
#' (respectively forward and backward probability row-wise vectors) such
#' that \code{normalize(alpha[i] * beta[i])} is the smoothed HMM state estimate.

    # 'fwd' corresponds to the FORWARD function as defined in Eq. 15.5 of Russell and Norvig's book.

    # vector of dimension nQ for the steps up to the previous one. Argument 'i' is an integer which
    # represents an observation ID. Output corresponds to 'fv[i]', i.e. a single forward message vector
    # of dimension nQ.
    # 
    # WARNING: the function depends on the values of probTran, indf and nQ which are defined
    # one level above and ARE NOT passed as parameters.  This is suboptimal but necessary due
    # to the fact that fwd is called by the Reduce function which has strict requirements
    # on the function's interface.

                  # where some interaction happens between fv[i] and b.  Ã‰G 2019/06/10.

    # 'bwd' corresponds to the BACKWARD function as defined in Eq. 15.9 of Russell and Norvig.  Arguments are reversed
    # (relative to 'fwd' and also to the paper) because of the call by Reduce with option 'right = TRUE'.
    # Argument 'prob' corresponds to b of figure 15.4 in the book, i.e. a single backward message
    # vector of dimension nQ for the steps down to the next one. Argument 'i' is an integer which
    # represents an observation ID. Output corresponds to 'b' a single backward message vector
    # of dimension nQ.

    # seem to occur outside of function forwardback.
