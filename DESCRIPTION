Description: Implements 4 models to estimate travel time distribution with different types of dependencies. A Hidden Markov Model is used to capture dependency on hidden congestion states. A trip effect is used to capture dependency on driver behaviour. Variations of those two types of dependencies leads to four models to estimate the distribution of travel time. Prediction methods for each model is provided.
